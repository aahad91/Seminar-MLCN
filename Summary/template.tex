\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In recent years, with the evolution of technology IoT devices are increasing day
by day. These IoT devices serve mankind in different ways such as smart cities,
smart transportation, water, and waste management. With this increasing number of devices,
the management and communication between these devices are one of the main issues. Fog computing
addresses this issue by connecting heterogeneous IoT devices in a network and all the processing
is done at the device level. Fog computing is the extension of cloud computing but decentralized.
\par
Fog computing is responsible for providing resources to IoT devices for processing. Traditionally
these resources are allocated as VMs from different cloud infrastructures such as AWS, Google,
OpenStack, etc. to run the applications. VMs are considered resource greedy
and require more computational resources. Alternate is to use the Containers such as Docker
which are light-weight, requires less resources and based on micro-service architecture.
Large applications are split into containers based on the main processes of the application.
This increasing number of containers per application required the proper monitoring for health check
and resource consumption. The most commonly used orchestrator for containers is Kubernetes.
\par
Kubernetes is an open-source platform for management,deployment and scaling of containers.
Kubernetes architecture is based on the master-slave model. Its consist of one master node and
multiple worker node. Worker node provides the compute power. Master node communicates
with the worker nodes using API, it is also responsible scheduling and deploying the containers
across the cluster of worker nodes. An application consisting of multiple containers are deployed
as a pod in Kubernetes. Each pod consist of only one IP address and all the underlying containers
communicate using different ports. Different pods are isolated from each other and underlying
containers cannot communicate across pods. After receiving the pod configurations from the user, master node
schedules these pods based on the availability of resources on different worker nodes.
\par
When the new pod configurations are provided, pods are added to the waiting queue. Default Kubernetes
scheduler monitors the waiting queue for pods and deploys the pod on a specific worker node based on
a scheduling mechanism. scheduling is performed in two steps, first is the "node filtering" and
second is "node priority calculation". In first step worker node is selected by applying filters \cite{k8s}
such as "PodFitsResources", "NoDiskConflict", "PodFitsHostPorts" etc. Selected nodes are then prioritized
in second step by calculating "LeastRequestPriority", "MostRequestedPriority", "CalculateAntiAffinityPriority"
etc. These scheduling is performed by considering resources such as CPU, memory, disk etc and network is not
considered.
\par
Considering one use-case of IoT such as smart cities, where IoT applications collect the air quality data. Data is
considered sensitive, making sure that no data is lost while it transmitted, making network configuration one of the
main issues while deploying such applications. Default Kubernetes scheduler does not check for the latency and available bandwidth
at a particular worker node. Considering this drawback, the author proposed a new network-based scheduler for pod deployment
across worker nodes. This network scheduler is an extension of the default Kubernetes scheduler. This scheduler works
in two steps, firstly calculates the Round Trip Time(RTT) to the target node mentioned in the pod configuration file
and selects the node with minimum RTT. Second, it calculates the bandwidth of node and compares it with the bandwidth
provided in the pod configuration based on best-fit selection. Results show that this network-based scheduler can
improve the performance of Kubernetes by 80\% in terms of network latency\cite{Santos2019}.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In \cite{Wobker2018}, "Fogernetes"- fog computing platform is presented that manages and deploys fog applications.
  \item In \cite{gog}, "Firmament" - centralized scheduler. It schedules the tasks considering the network latency.
  \item In \cite{MichaelChimaOgbuachiAnnaRealePeterSuskovics}, considering scheduling issues in 5G infrastructure, author
  propsed solution based on considering physical, operational and network parameters along with the software states.
  \item In \cite{Bittencourt2017}, dicussed about scheduling issues in fog computing, mentioned three scheduling policies
  that can improve the execution of application.

%The related work section could describe other work that is in some
%respects relevant for the understanding of the problem outlined in
%Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, that offer competing solutions, etc.

%All sources must be properly referenced, ideally by using the BiBTeX
%system. References can then be very conveniently made with the
%\texttt{cite} command. For example, reference
%\citenum{leuwen00:_handb_schol} discusses some of the elementary rules on
%writing scientific papers, amongst others how to correctly cite other
%documents. \citeauthor{Taylor:SIGuide:95}, e.g., describes how to
%correctly use the SI system of units and their correct typographical
%representation \citep{Taylor:SIGuide:95}.

%Since we are using the  \texttt{natbib} package in this template, it is %also convenient to
%to directly refer to the author names via the cite command -- see
%above for an example and check the natbib manual,\footnote{\url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/natbib}}  very powerful!



%\section{Model description}
%\label{sec:model}

%After the two common sections Introduction and Related work, more
%sections with the actual content of a paper follow. The style and
%structure of such sections varies by a large degree, no general rules
%of thumb can be given.

%Such a section could, among other things, include a figure. Note that
%a figure is a so-called floating object: it is moved around the actual
%text in order to best fit on a page. This is in stark contrast to some
%GUI-based word processing tools, where the placement of figures is
%usually more associated with luck than principle.

%As figures float around, expressions like ``the following figure''
%must never be used. Instead, figures need a caption, a label, and must
%be properly referenced in the main text. An example for this concept
%is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example}.

%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%  \begin{center}
%    \includegraphics{example}
%    \caption{An example figure with a caption.}
%    \label{fig:example}
%  \end{center}
%\end{figure}

%In general, only vector graphics in encapsulated postscript (eps)
%format should be included in any kind of text, as this allows arbirary
%scaling, rotation etc.\ without any loss of quality. Bitmap formats
%(JPEG, GIF, \dots) should only be used if no other alternative exists
%--- basically the only case where bitmaps can be justified is when
%scanned pictures need to be included in a text, however, this should
%be avoided as hard as possible as the quality in usually not
%satisfactory. EPS files can easily be produced by most tools; for
%particular difficult cases, tools like WMF2EPS can be helpful.

%\section{Word processing \& \LaTeX}
%\label{sec:latex}

%This document has already introduced the most important constructs of
%\LaTeX. What is necessary to produce documents with \LaTeX is simple
%any normal text editor and a \LaTeX distribution. This is commonly
%installed on practically all UNIX-type systems; for Windows, an
%excellent \LaTeX exists, called MikTeX, available from
%\url{www.miktex.org}. Almost all distributions come with a large patch
%of examples and introductory material; consult your local installation
%for details.

%Lots of supplementary and background information, FAQs, etc.\ is
%available from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN); the
%German mirror of which is \url{www.dante.de}.

%\section{Conclusion}
%\label{sec:concl}

%At the end, there is a final section concluding and summarizing a
%paper, putting the entire work into perspective and explaining, on a
%larger level, what the consequences of this work are. Also, unexpected
%results can be discussed here, etc.
